# Task 37 Implementation Summary: Request Permissions for Alert Functionality

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive permission management for location and notification access required for the Duress Proximity Alerts feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Permission Management Module (`src/lib/permissions.ts`)

**Key Features:**
- `requestLocationPermission()`: Requests foreground location permission with rationale
- `requestNotificationPermission()`: Requests notification permission with rationale
- `requestAlertPermissions()`: Convenience function to request both permissions
- `checkAlertPermissions()`: Check if all required permissions are granted

**Permission Rationale:**
- **Location**: "We use your location to enhance security and provide emergency assistance if needed. This enables proximity alerts when colleagues nearby are in distress."
- **Notifications**: "We need notification permission to alert you about critical security events, even when the app is in the background. This ensures you receive timely proximity alerts."

**Graceful Degradation:**
- All permission requests return boolean (true/false) instead of throwing errors
- Permission denial is logged as warnings, not errors
- App continues to function even if permissions are denied
- Uses SecureStore to track if permissions have been requested to avoid repeated prompts

### 2. Updated Storage Module (`src/lib/storage.ts`)

Added generic storage functions to support permission tracking:
- `setItem(key, value)`: Store any key-value pair
- `getItem(key)`: Retrieve any stored value
- `deleteItem(key)`: Delete any stored value

### 3. Updated LoginScreen (`src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx`)

**Integration Points:**
- Removed old location permission request from `useEffect`
- Added `requestAlertPermissions()` call after successful authentication
- Permissions are requested in the background without blocking navigation
- Logs permission status for debugging

**Flow:**
1. User successfully authenticates (NORMAL or DURESS)
2. Session is set in auth store
3. Navigation happens automatically via auth gate
4. Permission requests run in background:
   - Shows location rationale alert
   - Requests location permission
   - Shows notification rationale alert
   - Requests notification permission
   - Configures Android notification channel if granted
5. Logs results without blocking user experience

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **34.1**: Request foreground location permission on first authentication
✅ **34.2**: Request notification permission on first authentication  
✅ **34.3**: Explain location is needed for proximity alerts before requesting
✅ **34.4**: Explain notifications are needed for background alerts before requesting
✅ **34.5**: Continue to function when permissions are denied

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **First Launch Flow:**
   - Install app fresh
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Verify location rationale alert appears
   - Grant/deny location permission
   - Verify notification rationale alert appears
   - Grant/deny notification permission
   - Verify app continues to work regardless of permission choices

2. **Subsequent Launches:**
   - Login again
   - Verify permissions are not requested again (already marked as requested)
   - Check that app respects previously granted/denied permissions

3. **Permission Denial:**
   - Deny location permission
   - Verify app logs warning but continues to function
   - Verify proximity alerts are limited (as expected)
   - Deny notification permission
   - Verify app logs warning but continues to function
   - Verify background alerts won't work (as expected)

4. **Android-Specific:**
   - Verify notification channel "Duress Alerts" is created
   - Check channel settings (high importance, vibration, red light)

### Automated Testing:
- Unit tests for permission functions (mock expo-location and expo-notifications)
- Integration tests for LoginScreen permission flow
- Test permission tracking in SecureStore

## Notes

- Permissions are requested **after** successful authentication, not on app launch
- This ensures users understand the context before being asked for permissions
- Permission rationale is shown via Alert dialogs before requesting
- Permission status is tracked in SecureStore to avoid repeated prompts
- All permission operations are non-blocking and fail gracefully
- Android notification channel is automatically configured when notification permission is granted
